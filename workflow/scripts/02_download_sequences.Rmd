# Downloading the fastq files

## Using fasterq-dump
- Be sure that the `fasterq-dump` is in the path.
- Type `which fasterq-dump` to confirm if is in the path.
- Use the absolute path like `~/sratoolkit.3.0.0-mac64/bin/fasterq-dump` if the executable file is not in the path.
- The example below uses absolute path to execute the `fasterq-dump` command.

> In this demo the sratoolkit `~/sratoolkit.3.0.0-mac64` folder is in the home directory.
> Notice that the output and temporary files are placed in an external volume mounted to the computer.


```bash
for (( i = 706; i <= 761; i++ ))
	do
		time ~/sratoolkit.3.0.0-mac64/bin/fasterq-dump SRR7450$i \
		-O /Volumes/SeagateTMB/SRA/BUSHMEAT/SRR7450/ \
		-t /Volumes/SeagateTMB/SRA/BUSHMEAT/SRR7450/tmpfiles \
		--threads 4 \
		--split-3;
